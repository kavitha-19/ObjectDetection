# ObjectDetection
> <b>Introduction to YOLO Object Detection</b>: I familiarized myself with the YOLO algorithm and its implementation for real-time object detection tasks.

> <b>Installation of Required Libraries</b>: I installed OpenCV and other necessary libraries to facilitate the implementation of the YOLO model.

> <b>Dataset Preparation and Annotation</b>: I prepared a dataset for training the YOLO model, meticulously annotating objects of interest to ensure accurate training.

> <b>Training the YOLO Model</b>: Utilizing the Darknet framework, I trained the YOLO model on the prepared dataset to recognize and localize objects within images.

> <b>Fine-Tuning for Improved Accuracy</b>: I performed fine-tuning on the pre-trained YOLO model to enhance its accuracy and adapt it to specific requirements.

> <b>Testing and Evaluation</b>: Following training, I rigorously tested the trained model on both images and videos to assess its performance and ensure robustness.

><b> Results Visualization and Parameter Tuning</b>: I visualized the detection results and iteratively tuned the model parameters to optimize performance and achieve superior results.
